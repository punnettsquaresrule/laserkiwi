Hi, I'm Katie. I've spent the past 10 years traveling around the world. I was born in the United States, but spent the past 8 years living in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 

It's been a lifelong dream of mine to go to New Zealand, so I dropped everything and decided to move countries again!

When I'm not blogging, I'm working as a freelance UI/UX designer. Check out [my work](www.katiemacoy.com).


####Where did the name Laser Kiwi come from?
You may have heard that New Zealand recently had a vote to change their flag. One flag option that got a lot attention was Laser Kiwi designed by James Gray:

<blockquote class="u--startsWithDoubleQuote">"The laser beam projects a powerful image of New Zealand. I believe my design is so powerful it does not need to be discussed."</blockquote>

I'm truly disappointed this flag didn't get chosen to represent my new home, so I honor it with my blog title.
