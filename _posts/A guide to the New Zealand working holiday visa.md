Deciding to take a year sabbatical in New Zealand is an exciting step. If you’re me, it’s also somewhat of a terrifying step. This guide aims to help you navigate through the bureaucracy involved in getting the visa. 

##What is the New Zealand working holiday visa?

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}couple.jpg);"></div>

The New Zealand working holiday visa is a great way for young people to get to know New Zealand. You can stay in the country for a year (in some cases 2 years) and travel and work freely. That means you can take a seasonal job on a farm and backpack around, or an office job and settle in a city for a year. The choice is yours! You are also free to leave and re-enter the country so you could travel to interesting places near New Zealand (near is a relative term here). While many countries have working holiday visas, I think New Zealand's is the most advantageous because it's SO FAR AWAY from everything, it seems better to make the cost of the plane ticket last by staying for longer! Sound interesting? Read on!

**Disclaimer:** I’m not an immigration lawyer. This guide is based on personal experience and you should always do your own research. The [New Zealand immigration website](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas) is actually surprisingly helpful, as immigration websites go. This post is written in June 2016 so rules and requirements may change.

##Before you apply
### Step 1: Decide

This goes without saying, but make 100% sure this a decision that you can commit to. Once you’ve been granted the visa, you use it or lose it. Once you have granted application, you have 1 year to use it. If you don't use it within that 1 year you lose the visa AND you can never apply for it again. So choose wisely! 


### Step 2: Does your country qualify? 

New Zealand only has a working visa partnership with these select countries.

*Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Peru, Poland, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, the USA, Vietnam.*

I believe all countries have a 12 month visa, with the exception of the UK and Canada, both of whom can stay up to 23 months. As if life wasn't already good enough for Brits and Canadians with their socialized healthcare and gay marriage... hmph

Also good to note: get your application in as soon as possible. More than half of the countries on this list have quotas of how many people can enter per year. For example, only 300 Brazilians can enter New Zealand under the working holiday scheme per year. 

I suggest you check the [New Zealand immigration website](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/options/work/explore-work-visa-options) to see if the quota for you country has already been reached.

### Step 3: Do you fulfill the basic requirements?

Still reading? Haven't closed your laptop in a rage? Then you country probably qualifies. Here are the basic personal requirements:

####You are between 18 and 30 years old at the time of applying
This means you can apply at 30 and enter at 31. Just in time for your quarter life crisis!

####You have $4,200 New Zealand dollars
And can prove it! You may be asked at the border to show a bank statement to prove you have the funds. $4,200 is approximately $3,000 USD or €2.500 euro. Currency worth fluctuates so double check when you travel.

####You have ticket out of New Zealand -or- enough money to buy one
You may be asked to prove this at the border. Immigration authorities want to know that you can get out New Zealand when your visa expires. If you don't have your ticket, the money to buy one is factored in _on top of_ the $4,200 you need for the visa. I've never seen a figure listed as to what a plane ticket out of New Zealand should cost. I'm planning on bringing an extra $1,000 NZD, so a total of $5,200 NZD.

####You have medical insurance for the duration of your stay in New Zealand
Obtaining medical insurance is a confusing nightmare, check out my [in-depth post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/06/07/how-to-get-health-insurance-for-your-year-abroad.html) explaining how I obtained my health insurance. 

####You fulfill character requirements
If you've never convicted of a crime, deported, or imprisoned: you're fine, on to the next. 

If you have: there's still hope for you. Some offenses can be overlooked if you also provide a character waiver and explaination. You can find all the details on [this section of the New Zealand immigration website](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/tools-and-information/character-and-identity/good-character). 

####You fulfill health requirements
If you do **not**:

* have a condition that requires frequent medical care
* require dialysis
* have tuberculosis (TB)
* have a mental disorder that requires hospital care
* have a disability that requires full-time care

Then you're probably fine.
If you do have any of the above, check [this link](http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@ed_protect/@protrav/@ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_117428.pdf) to see if you still qualify. 

####Extra check for tuberculosis(TB)
Some people will need submit a chest X-ray with their application. 

If you're **NOT** from applying with a passport from the following countries you will have to submit a Temporary Entry X-ray Certificate with your application.

*Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic Denmark Dominica, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Iceland, Ireland, Israel (including the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and including East Jerusalem), Italy, Jamaica, Jordan, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Puerto Rico, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, San Marino, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicaos Islands, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America, United States Virgin Islands, Vatican City.*

If you have spent more than 3 months in the past 5 years in one or more of the countries **not** listed, you will also need to submit an X-ray with your application.

[Check this PDF to find out more about the X-ray certificate.](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/documents/forms-and-guides/inz1096.pdf)

####You have a passport that is valid for at least 3 months after your planned departure
That means if you plan to enter New Zealand on January 1 2016, you need to have a passport that is valid until *at least* April 1 2017. I wouldn't recommend cutting it that close though.

####You won't be bringing anyone with you
No children, spouses, etc. If you want to bring someone, they are responsible for obtaining a visa for themselves.

Did you make it this far? Good job! Please enjoy this picture of New Zealand for your troubles:<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}prettyNZ.jpg);"></div>

## Apply for the visa online

It's only possible to apply for the New Zealand working holiday visa scheme online. The visa also has a one-time cost of $165 NZD. In order to have your application processed, you need to pay the fee. You can only pay with MasterCard or Visa.

The process of applying is extremely straightforward. These screenshots should help. 

####1. Head over to [this section of the New Zealand immigration website.](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/options/work/explore-work-visa-options) and fill in your info.
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}yourinfo.jpg);"></div>

####2. Select the working holiday box and click view
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}workingholidayselection.jpg);"></div>

####3. Select the working holiday box and click through until you can apply:
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}login.jpg);"></div>

####4. Create an account, then log in
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}registration.jpg);"></div>

####5. Select working holiday visa on the onlines services page
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}online-services.jpg);"></div>

####6. Apply by filling out all fields
You can always save and come back later to complete your application. In truth the entire thing took me 10 minutes.

**Make sure the passport name and number you fill in are EXACTLY as they appear on your passport.** If not your visa will not be valid.

The fields are split up into tabs. Keep in mind that the tabs have sub-tabs (highlighted in this photo as personal details, identification, occupation details)
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}tabs.jpg);"></div>

The questions are so straight forward that you should be able to figure it yourself. Only one question has slightly weird phrasing:
<blockquote class="u--startsWithDoubleQuote">"In the five years prior to this application, have you spent (lived in and/or visited) a combined total of 3 months in any country or countries NOT considered to be low risk for TB"</blockquote>
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}weirdquestion.jpg);"></div>

The answer they want is preferably a NO. What they're asking is if you've been to any country where tuberculosis (TB) is a problem. 

Obviously if you have lived in / visited such a country, you need to answer yes. You may need to submit an X-ray with your application. See my section about tuberculosis above. 

When you've answered everything the tabs will all have a green checkmark. Double check and submit the application. 
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}alltabs.jpg);"></div>

####7. Pay
Your application will not be processed until you pay $165 NZD. If your application is denied, you will lose this money.

####8. Wait for an answer
My answer came within 24 hours. I've seen various figures online, but most people receive an answer within 5 working days. You can check the status of your application on [New Zealand online services](https://onlineservices.immigration.govt.nz). On the right hand side of the screen you can see your applications
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}immigrationstatus.jpg);"></div>

####9. Approval hopefully!
You'll be able to see if you're approved on the left hand side of online services. Clicking through will show you the following:
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}approved.jpg);"></div>

You will also recieve an email within a few days. You'll need to print out your e-visa and take it to the airport with you. It looks rather unofficial but I guess it's all you need!
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}workvisa.jpg);"></div>

**What if the visa was denied?**
First of all, sorry. 
I don't have personal experience with getting my visa denied. There are ways to [appeal](http://www.justice.govt.nz/tribunals/immigration-protection-tribunal/how-to-make-a-claim) the decision. 

Having experienced visa problems moving to Europe, I would give general advice to seek an immigration lawyer's help if you think you were denied unfairly. 

## After your visa is granted
You're going to New Zealand. Congratulations!!
