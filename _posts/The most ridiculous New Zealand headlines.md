For the past 3 months I've been researching my imminent move to New Zealand. Somehow this country produces an alarming amount of strange news. I've collected a few of my favorites:

##John Key: prime minister

I don't know too much about his politics, but for some reason headlines about this guy have been in my peripheral vision for months before I even considered moving to New Zealand. 

How? With shit like this:
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}headlines/call.jpg);"></div>
[Source](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11329574)

He also made international news with "Ponytail gate", where he allegedly harrased a woman by repeatedly tugging on her ponytail:
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}headlines/johnkey.jpg);"></div>
[Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/22/new-zealand-prime-minister-john-key-apologises-for-pulling-waitresss-hair)

According to the woman he harassed, he said: 
<blockquote class="u--startsWithDoubleQuote">"That's a very tantalizing ponytail"</blockquote>

That's a very unsettling thing to say, John Key.

####Making light of a serious topic

John Key also felt some kind of need to wear a t-shirt saying "I'm not sorry for being a man". While this is a somewhat benign statement in itself, in context it's pretty revolting.

<blockquote class="u--startsWithDoubleQuote">The shirt is a reference to a speech former Labour leader David Cunliffe made at a Women’s Refuge symposium, when he said, “I’m sorry for being a man … because family and sexual violence is perpetrated overwhelmingly by men against women and children.”</blockquote><br>

Way to make it about you, man.

There is so much more weird stuff on the internet about this guy, but I'll end this bit with the gif that introduced me to John Key:

What a gem.

##People didn't take the flag competition too seriously
The New Zealand government held a referendum to redesign the flag in 2015 and allowed citizens to submit new flag designs. People didn't take it too seriously. Here are a few designs that were submitted to the New Zealand government:
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}headlines/flag1.png);"></div>
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}headlines/flag2.png);"></div>
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}headlines/flag3.png);"></div>
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}headlines/flag4.png);"></div>
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}headlines/flag5.png);"></div>

And of course, the inspiration for this blog:
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}headlines/flag6.png);"></div>

##Personal favorite:
Let's not forget that in 1984 the New Zealand Prime Minister got drunk and decided to spontaneously call a general election, which he lost.<br>

Something about this country attracts strange headlines. I leave you with this cringe inducing video of the prime minister doing Gangnam Style:
