Moving abroad is super exciting, but the legwork that it takes is not. For me packing is something I usually put off until the last possible moment, usually done on the same morning I step on the plane. While this is an efficient method, it's not one I'd recommend when you're planning to uproot your life to another country.

This guide aims to help take the stress away from packing up your life

##A backpackers packing list:
This is list is for young people going on a one year adventure, not for families!

####Clothing
- 2 weeks worth of underwear, bras, socks
- 5 - 6 t-shirts
- 3 - 4 long sleeve shirts or cardigans
- 2 sweaters
- 2 - 3 pairs of jeans
- 2 sets of pajamas
- A decent rain jacket
- A solid winter jacket
- A formal outfit
- A bathing suit
- 2 - 3 Shorts or skirts
- Long underwear
- 1 pair of sandals 
- 1 pair of flat shoes
- 1 pair of winter boots
- 1 pair of hiking boots (if you plan to hike)
- Purse/day backpack
- Some jewelery
- A towel

####Toiletries
I would generally advise against packing your weight in toiletries as you can generally buy these where ever you end up. Do a bit of research into your destination to see if they have any customs that you can't live with (i.e. tampons are hard to come by in many Asian countries). In that case: bring a year supply with you. Otherwise, just bring what you need to get your life started.

- Your basic makeup kit, perfume
- Deodorant, shampoo, soap, lotion, floss to last you a month
- Hairbrush
- Sunscreen
- Toothbrush + toothpaste
- Basic medical kit: you can buy these in travel shops or [make your own](http://www.redcross.org/prepare/location/home-family/get-kit/anatomy)
- Mosquito net, deet, and malaria pills if necessary 

####Reminders of home
- Physical pictures of your loved ones
- A bit of your favorite (non-perishable) food
- The flag of your country

####Electronics
- An unlocked cell phone
- An e-reader
- Headphones
- A camera (waterproof if possible!)
- A laptop/tablet if you want

####Handy to have
- Copies of all of your important documents
- A sewing kit
- 1 - 2 converters for the plugs
- Electronic chargers, extra cables
- Passport photos
- A notebook + pen


##Research your destination
The most important thing you can do to ensure your landing is as soft as possible is to do lots of research into the weather and customs of your destination.

####Culture
Many countries around the world still have a culture of modest dress. In a few countries modest dress is actually the law. Though most countries are more tolerant to people who are obviously foreigners, you may need to leave your miniskirts and tank tops at home.

In Thailand culturally it's somewhat expected to dress somewhat modestly: as in thighs and shoulders covered. Thai people didn't appear care overtly what foreigners wore on the street. However, modest dress is absolutely required to enter the beautiful Thai temples. Over and over again, I witnessed fellow tourists strolling right past the signs asking them to cover up and visiting the temples shirtless or in short sun dresses. Don't be that asshole. Respect the culture of your new home, you're a guest.

####Weather
Check out the [yearly highs and lows](https://weatherspark.com/) in your destination and pack accordingly. Also note rainfall and wind: I've talked to a few kiwis about my imminent move to Wellington and every single one has mentioned the amount of rain and wind.

##Backpack, suitcase, or boxes?


####Backpack
Only if you're planning to be truly nomadic and not settle anywhere longer than a few weeks. Even large hiking backpacks don't fit that much and they are a hassle as you constantly have to pack and re-pack them.

####Suitcase
 If you're planning on settle somewhere for six months or longer: plan on bringing a large suitcase (or two, if you can stomach the airline fees). Note that airline weight limit on suitcases is usually around 23 kg (50 lbs). 

####Boxes
If you're planning on moving somewhere for the rest of your life, you may want to ship boxes. This is quite an expensive option, so do consider if your possesions are worth the enormous cost of shipping. I would only advise shipping things with sentimental value or that aren't available in your destination. 


##Buying versus taking
Try to keep in mind that even if you forget essential items, you can always buy them at your destination. I'd say opt to pack light, and even so you'll probably end up with more stuff than you have room for. 

However, there are a few items that may be lacking in your new home.

####Things that are worth taking

If you're moving from the west to Asia, you may have trouble finding **bras, panties, and shoes** that are big enough! 

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}packing/underwear.jpg);"></div>


Another big one is **over the counter medicine**. Lots of countries have strict regulations about medicine so it may be wise to take a year's supply of cough and cold medicine. 

For me the two things I ended up importing were **deodorant and birth control**. Moving from the US to Europe - the deodorant here is just weak and soaks your clothes; most people use spray deodorant which I find repulsive for some reason.

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}packing/pills.jpg);"></div>

Europe is pretty chill about birth control, but the brand my body was used to wasn't sold over here. Having been through the emotional and hormonal hell of switching birth control pills, I decided to import large amounts of it. It was a somewhat awkward conversation with my doctor.

##Getting rid of your stuff
You'll probably have a huge amount of stuff that you'll be leaving behind. It's tempting to store everything, but the chances are if you're not taking it, you'll soon forget it. I limit myself to one box of sentimental items that it's not worth dragging across the world. The rest I sell, donate, and throw away.

Try to start packing 1 or 2 weeks before your departure date, that way you have time sell your stuff and maybe make some extra travel money.

##How to get it there
####Via airplane
If you pack light, you can take everything you own on an airplane. Most airlines will let check have one bag up to 23 kg (50 lbs) for free on international flights. Do check that the bag will be free - some airlines have even started charging baggage fees for international flights.

You can usually check a second bag also weighing up to 23 kg (50 lbs) for under $100.

####Ship your suitcase
If you don't want to deal with the hassle of dragging your bag around and already have destination in mind you can ship your bag. This is a pricey option - so have a good reason. 

Some companies:<br>
[Luggage Forward (DHL sub company)](https://www.luggageforward.com/)<br>
[Luggage Free](https://www.luggagefree.com/)<br>
[Send my bag](https://www.sendmybag.com/)<br>

I'll be shipping my bag to New Zealand (long story) so I'll write about my experience here.

####International Moving companies
If you are moving for good, you're going to have a lot of stuff. In that case I'd recommend an international moving company. These really vary based on your current location and destination so check out a [quote comparision](https://www.intlmovers.com/) site to get tailored advice.
