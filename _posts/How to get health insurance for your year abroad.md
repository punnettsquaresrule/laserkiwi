__Reminder that this is based on personal experience. I may be wrong about any of these facts. Do your own research as well!__

If you're anything like me, getting health insurance is one of those things that you file away on a to-do list in the back of your mind, along with a bunch of other adult-y stuff you don't really understand.

I'm originally from the USA, which by all accounts is a health insurance nightmare. Having left at 18 years old, I was always covered by my parents plan. Phew, adulthood dodged; I did not yet need to learn about health insurance.

I then moved to the Netherlands. I was told having health insurance was mandatory. In the Netherlands insurance providers are more or less exactly the same in price and quality (thanks socialist government), so I just picked the one with prettiest logo and payed €70 per month. Done. Easy.

Then I decided to become a bit more nomadic. This is where insurance troubles begin. Insurers like stable clients that are fixed to one country. Luckily, or perhaps unluckily, there is a whole industry of medical insurance providers that will charge you an arm and a leg to keep your respective arms and legs healthy. There are so many scammy-looking sites, dodgey providers, and companies taking advantage of people! 

Wading through this is a nightmare, so please accept this picture of an alarmed cat to help ease the pain.

##What kind of insurance do you need?
<blockquote class="u--startsWithDoubleQuote">"You must maintain your medical insurance while in New Zealand." </blockquote>

Pretty vague! From what I understand you just need any insurance to cover medical expenses while traveling in NZ. There are a number of travel/backpackers insurance providers that will do that.

##Can I use my existing health insurance?
Probably not. Insurers are not the most flexible. For example, I called my Dutch insurer and while they will usually give me (minimal) coverage while traveling, they automatically cancel my insurance when I no longer have a Dutch address.

Even if your insurer would cover you, it may end up in headaches regarding getting treatment abroad. I opted for travel-specific insurance because they cover things that backpackers/travelers will more likely encounter.

When I traveled in Europe with American insurance, when I saw a doctor in Europe I had to pay out of pocket for the entire cost of the visit and MONTHS later I would see the money from my American insurance company. Too much hassle.

##How do I choose health insurance?
The amount of coverage you opt for depends on what kind of person you are. The basics I would suggest:

* Ability to cancel your trip or shift the dates
* Medical coverage of minimum £2 million ($3 million USD)
* Emergency evacuation or emergency transport home
* Insurance in the event that you've injured someone 
* Insurance in the event that you've been injured by someone 
* Insurance that will fly your body home if you were to die
* Legal expenses 

This is awful, have another cat picture.

##How much will it cost me?
Expect a range of **€200 - €400** per year for basic coverage. This rate will go up if you take additional insurance or have a pre-existing condition.

It's important to note to always disclose your pre-existing condition. If you should receive treatment without having disclosed it, your insurer has grounds to not pay out for your treatment. They are bastards.

##How do I choose an insurer? 
There are just too many insurers out there. My general tips are:

* Make a list what you want to do in your destination
* Make a list of what you want covered (if you don't know, just stick to my list above)
* Do a few Google searches comparing various insurers
* Just pick one: Don't make yourself crazy.
* Do always check the reviews!

For a gap year, here are some of the big players:<br>
[Columbus Direct](http://www.columbusdirect.com/): Good reviews<br> 
[International Medical Group](http://www.imglobal.com/en/index.aspx): Good reviews<br>
[JS Insurance](https://www.jsinsurance.co.uk/single-trip-travel-insurance.html): Good reviews<br>
[World Nomads](https://www.worldnomads.com/): So-so reviews<br>

I've left out some big, well-known ones because they've got absolutely terrible reviews, such as STA Travel:

yikes.

**New Zealand Specific Insurers**<br>
[Southren Cross](https://www.scti.co.nz/visiting-new-zealand) Good reviews<br>
[DU Insure](http://www.duinsure.com/sites/duinsure.nsf/PagesBySection/Downunder_insurance_purchase) So-so reviews<br>

In the end I opted from [Southren Cross](https://www.scti.co.nz/visiting-new-zealand). I wanted to make sure I had an insurer who knew the local systems. This insurance was also recommended to me by kiwi friends, plus it has great reviews. I will update this post to write about my experience if/when I use it!

##What about other kinds of insurance?
Even though it's not strictly required, you may want to opt for more than just health insurance. Often whoever you choose as your health insurer can also provide you additional insurances (for an additional cost, of course).

Personally I opt for the bare-minimum health coverage and nothing more. I figure, probably something terrible will happen once or twice in my life that disrupts my entire trip. I will probably pay less over my life paying a one time high cost out-of-pocket rather than a lifetime of small fees from insurance companies. If it gives you piece of mind while traveling to be insured, by all means!

Some additional insurances to think about:

**Winter sport insurance / scuba diving insurance**<br>
These are generally not covered in basic insurance so if you plan to do either, take out an additional policy. Pretty much any sport that you plan to do often (mountain biking, climbing, etc) you may want additional coverage

**Search and rescue**<br>
Insurance that will cover you if you were to be lost hiking or exploring.

**Baggage, money, possessions**<br>
Some people who are clumsy or just want piece of mind will want to take out additional coverage for their possessions. Note that the insurer will only honor reasonable claims, so accidents due to personal negligence will not yield payout.

**Cancellation / trip flexibility**<br>
What happens if your airline goes out of business? A natural disaster prevents your trip? You can take out insurance to cover these unexpected occurrences. 

####That's it! You can now have a gap-year worry free about medical expenses.
