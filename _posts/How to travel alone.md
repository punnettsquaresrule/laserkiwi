The day of my high school graduation, I took off my white gown and cap and went to the airport to board a plane to northern Finland. Before this point, I had never left the United States, unless you count a few small trips to Canada (but let's be honest, Canada doesn't count).

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}travel-alone/graduation.jpg);"></div>

I went alone. I didn't even consider the possibility of going with other people. It's been almost 10 years since that day, and I've since traveled to about 25 countries and immigrated to Europe. I've done most of this travel alone, and traveling alone is still my favorite way to travel.

##Why travel alone?
####Traveling alone is therapy
As a person you don't really grow until you put yourself outside of your comfort zone. Nothing pushes your limits like travel. Traveling alone especially forces you to be with yourself, and without the distractions of daily routines, you really are forced to face your demons. It can also show you what your passions are, what excites you, and what kind of people you want to surround yourself with.

####You can have the trip you want
The few times I traveled with a boyfriend, we would inevitably have one massive fight per trip. Not to mention some bickering here and there. I love traveling alone because I get to tailor the trip entirely to my wants and needs: from choosing the destination to the day-to-day activities. 

My absolute favorite thing to do in a city is literally just to walk around and look at everything. I have easily walked 8 hours in circles around a city for several days and been completely enthralled by it. I would be hard-pressed to find a partner who would also want to do that - and having someone there would ruin my peace and calm.<br>

<br>
####You can be spontaneous
One of the best benefits of traveling alone is that you're not bound to any itinerary. Being open to where travel takes you leads to far more interesting trips.

I started this trip with the intention of hitchhiking to Italy from the Netherlands (in February, hence the winter clothes. This may not have been a very wise plan.)

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}travel-alone/hitchhiking.jpg);"></div>

I didn't make it to Italy, but I did make it to Antwerp, the South of France, and finally Switzerland. Because I wasn't fussy as to where I would go, I was able to meet so many warm and interesting people and see so many places I would have never traveled to if I had stuck to the plan. 

I also got to fulfill a (albeit strange) lifelong dream to ride in an 18 wheeler:

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}travel-alone/truck.jpg);"></div>


####You learn more about the local culture
If you have a travel companion, most likely that person is from your country or at least has a similar culture. When you pop the bubble of cultural comfort you will also be more observant to what's around you.

When you have no one to talk to, you will inevitably talk to the locals. I've found it's much easier to make a one-to-one connection than approaching people as a group. 
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}travel-alone/japan.jpg);"></div>

####You meet interesting people along the way
When I traveled alone, I always made sure to stay in hostels or couch surf. That way I would immediately have access to a whole new group of people. When you travel with people you know, you will cling to the familiarity of their company in a new place. There is a special kind of bond that you make with someone who you meet traveling: you're both strangers in a strange place and you immediately have to trust and rely on each other. That builds bonds that can last for life.

##The downsides
####You miss the bonding of a shared experience
Having to confront new and challenging situations with a travel partner strengthens your trust. You learn a lot about your relationship and strengthen a bond. It's also nice to have someone to lean on when you're having a bad day.
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}travel-alone/niels.jpg);"></div>

####It can be lonely, and it can be exhausting
Despite the possibility of meeting lots of fellow travelers, sometimes you fall into a rut where you don't want to have another small talk conversation. You start to miss the comforts of familiarity.

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}travel-alone/bangkok.jpg);"></div>

####Eating alone is awkward
One of the best parts of traveling in general is getting to try all of the weird and wonderful food. 

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}travel-alone/bretzel.jpg);"></div>


This will often involve going to restaurants. If you're traveling alone you often don't have anyone to go with. So if you're like me: sitting alone in a restaurant is putting on display how much of a loser you are to the whole wide world.

####Safety, especially for women
Safety is a major concern while traveling alone. 

The pictures I posted on my Facebook from my Thailand trip looked like this:
<br>

<br>
However, Thailand looks more like this:
<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_posts_img }}travel-alone/thailand.jpg);"></div>

Thailand is actually an exceptionally safe country for solo travelers, but I did have a few hairy interactions and close calls.

Even the most experienced, level-headed traveler is more at risk while traveling alone. From nuisances like pick-pocketing, to much worse, a person alone is an easy target.

##How to do it

####Start small
If you've never traveled alone before, do a trip of a few days to introduce yourself to it and see if you like it. Preferably somewhere not too culturally different than your home, so you can focus on being alone rather than culture shock.

####Choose activities that are more fun alone
If you surround yourself with happy couples and friends, you may start to feel lonely. Choose activities that are more enjoyable alone, such as reading in a park, walking around, and visiting museums.

####Staying safe
The best way to stay safe is to use your common sense. No doubt you have certain basic things you do in your hometown. Traveling doesn't exempt you from doing these things.

You don't want to limit yourself too much in where you travel to, but do choose your destinations carefully. For example, check out this list of [the safest cities](http://theblondeabroad.com/2014/11/10/10-safest-destinations-solo-female-travelers/) to visit as a woman traveling alone.

Always tell people your plans. That way if you don't check in, they will know to check up on you. You can even leave notes in your hostel/hotel as to where you're going and when you expect to be back.

Do your research on the culture and try to blend in. You will mark yourself as an easy target if you stand out as a typical tourist. Don't wear flashy jewellery or whip out gadgets.

Stay in public spaces as much as possible.

####Staying sane

Sometimes travel can completely tire you out. Make sure not to push yourself too hard. 

Oftentimes I would arrive in a city with 10,000 plans but I was too physically and mentally exhausted to do anything but lay in bed. Remember that you don't **need** to do anything.

Actively practice [self care](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/internet-self-care/408580/) while traveling. Don't feel guilty for not living the trip to the fullest. Listen to what your body tells you and take care of your physical and mental health.

####Eating out
Eating out alone doesn't need to awkward. To make sure I experience foreign cuisine to the fullest I usually opt to eat lunch in cafes and would cook dinner at home. It's not strange to eat lunch alone, I do it at home all the time. I usually bring a book or a sketchpad to pass the time. Cooking dinner instead of eating out also saves a lot of money. 

You will probably meet lots of people in your travels, so if food is your passion, ask them to join for dinner.

You can always eat at markets and street vendors alone without feeling awkward. In my experience, markets have both the best and cheapest food.

####Meeting people 
If you're shy or a bit introverted, this could be the biggest fear preventing you from traveling alone. As a fellow shy/introverted person, I can tell you that it's easier than you think. If you stay in hostels or couchsurf, you would really have to try not to make friends. These days many people travel alone and are also looking for company. You already have a lot in common to talk about - you're both traveling alone and interested in the particular place where you are. Simply sit down and strike up a conversation.

**Tip**: Try to pick hostels that have a good common area.

You can also meet people through various online travel and meetup groups. Check out couchsurfing meetups in your area and meetup.com events. Ask the at the hotel/hostel/couch surfing place if there is something interesting going on in the city. That way you'll easily come into contact with lots of new and interesting travel buddies.

##Just try it.

I completely understand the fear of traveling alone. You think about your safety, if you'll have fun by yourself, if you'll meet people. Stop over-thinking and just book a small trip to see if you like it. You might, like me, get hooked on solo travel. The liberation and fun will wash away any fears.
